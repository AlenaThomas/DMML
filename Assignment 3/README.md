# Assignment 3: Semi-Supervised Learning

https://www.cmi.ac.in/~madhavan/courses/dmml2024/assignment3/

### The Task

In class, we saw an example of using clustering for semi-supervised learning of the MNIST dataset, where we used K-Means clustering to identify a small subset of labelled images to seed the classification process.

Your task is to conduct a similar experiment with the following two datasets.

1. The Fashion MNIST dataset for which we discussed how to build a neural network (multi-layer perceptron, MLP) model in lecture.

2. The [Overhead MNIST dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datamunge/overheadmnist/code) for which you can find a standard neural network (multi-layer perceptron, MLP) model [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/eriklarsen/omnist-baseline-models).

The MNIST example started with 50 clusters. Experiment with different (relatively small) values of K for these two datasets.
